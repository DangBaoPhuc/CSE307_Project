            <p>Souma Yukihira has been cooking alongside his father Jouichirou for as long as he can remember. As a sous
              chef at his father's restaurant, he has spent years developing his culinary expertise and inventing new
              dishes to amaze their customers. He aspires to exceed his father's skill and take over the restaurant one
              day, but he is shocked to learn that Jouichirou is closing up the shop to take a job in New York.

              Rather than tagging along with his father, Souma finds himself enrolling at the prestigious Tootsuki
              Culinary Academy, where only 10 percent of its students end up graduating. The school is famous for its
              "Shokugeki"—intense cooking competitions between students often used to settle debates and arguments.
              Jouichirou tells Souma that to surpass him and survive the next three years at Tootsuki and graduate
              there.

              The academy's brutal curriculum and fiercely competitive student body await the young chef, who must learn
              to navigate the treacherous environment if he wants to stand a chance at realizing his dreams. But is
              skill alone enough to let him rise to the top?</p>

            <p>It happened suddenly: The dead began to rise and Japan was thrown into total chaos. As these monsters
              begin terrorizing a high school, Takashi Kimuro is forced to kill his best friend when he gets bitten and
              joins the ranks of the walking dead. Vowing to protect Rei Miyamoto, the girlfriend of the man he just
              executed, they narrowly escape their death trap of a school, only to be greeted with a society that has
              already fallen.

              Soon, Takashi and Rei band together with other students on a journey to find their family members and
              uncover what caused this overwhelming pandemic. Joining them is Saeko Busujima, the beautiful president of
              the Kendo Club; Kouta Hirano, an otaku with a fetish for firearms; Saya Takagi, the daughter of an
              influential politician; and Shizuka Marikawa, their hot school nurse. But will the combined strength of
              these individuals be enough to conquer this undead apocalypse?</p>

            <p>The final hour of the popular virtual reality game Yggdrasil has come. However, Momonga, a powerful
              wizard and master of the dark guild Ainz Ooal Gown, decides to spend his last few moments in the game as
              the servers begin to shut down. To his surprise, despite the clock having struck midnight, Momonga is

            <p>The Four Cardinal Heroes are a group of ordinary men from modern-day Japan summoned to the kingdom of
              Melromarc to become its saviors. Melromarc is a country plagued by the Waves of Catastrophe that have
              repeatedly ravaged the land and brought disaster to its citizens for centuries. The four heroes are
              respectively bestowed a sword, spear, bow, and shield to vanquish these Waves. Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku,
              becomes cursed with the fate of being the "Shield Hero." Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is
              belittled and ridiculed by his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his weak offensive
              capabilities and lackluster personality.

              When the heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi sets out with the only
              person willing to train alongside him, Malty Melromarc. He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes
              falsely accused of taking advantage of her. Naofumi then becomes heavily discriminated against and hated
              by the people of Melromarc for something he didn't do. With a raging storm of hurt and mistrust in his
              heart, Naofumi begins his journey of strengthening himself and his reputation. Further along however, the
              difficulty of being on his own sets in, so Naofumi buys a demi-human slave on the verge of death named
              Raphtalia to accompany him on his travels.

              As the Waves approach the kingdom, Naofumi and Raphtalia must fight for the survival of the kingdom and
              protect the people of Melromarc from their ill-fated future.
